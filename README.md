Seven Languages in Seven Weeks
==============================

This is me working through the problems in the book "Seven Languages in Seven Weeks" by Bruce Tate.

Examples are organized by language and day of self study.

Contents
--------

### Ruby

* Day 1 (p. 35) - No files; these examples are all pretty much done through `irb`
* Day 2 (p. 48)
  * 01_sixteen_numbers.rb
  * 02_tree_from_hash.rb
  * 03_grep.rb
* Day 3 (pp. 55-56)
